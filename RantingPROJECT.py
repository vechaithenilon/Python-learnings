Hello World, its day 1!

Okay let me say this: I am currently writing base on the so called Happy Project that happens to be the same thing my girl
is doing. She just told me yesterday! How cool is that? Well, it is about writing anything that comes to your mind and put
them on the paper (or in this case, a program). To be honest, I did think about which platform should I write on as this
is a writing project. I can write on COld turkey something, a dedicated sofftware for writing, I can write on Word which has
a word count. In the end, I ended up writing on my Programming platform. Isnt that a LOL? Well, actuatually it makes sense as
with this I dont have to think about where to store the files and I also want to get more familiar to this UI, using this Pycharm
even more.
Enough with this reason, lets move on. What can I write about? Ah, the quarrel. Just last night on the bed we did have a fight
about me not appreciating the effort my gf made in cleaning my room. I am a man of focus; that means when I am focusing on
soemthing, I tend to have a tunnel vision which results in me leaving all other things outside my sight. Thanks to that concentration,
my room can sometimes be a mess and since I have no habbit of hanging my clothes on the reacket, this soon becomes the case.
Now its actually fine for me to be this way, but not for her. She prefers a clean room and she prefers me to be happy so she cleans
it up. *sigh* This is her way of showing how she cares for me and I know it is absolutely right. What else can it be? What can I say to
her in the morning so that we can all be happy?
"My dear, I am so sorry saying that way to you last night. We tend to take for granded what we currently have. My room would be" \
"terrebly messy without you. I know this is the way you show me love and I love it. Please forgive me for saying such rekkles things, I love" \
"you"

This should do it. THe point is to value her doing and showing her I am happy about her doing that. In the end, I need to
show her that I love her and I cannot be without her.
Okay I think this is a bit too much for a day. I am running out of time. Man, this is really time consuming. See you tomorrow!
